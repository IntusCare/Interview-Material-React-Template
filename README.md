## Coding Challenge, Basic Participant List Feature

##### Deployed site: https://intus-task-deployed-aw2b.vercel.app/


##### Ben's Notes/Bugs

* the toggle for sorting participants cycles through the following: `default` -> `reverse` -> `alphabetical`
* the absolutely positioned `back` button covers some of the text when the window width is reduced, would be on the to-fix list using relative positioning
* didn't get around to saving navigation history, unfortunately :(
